### [Streamlit](https://spotifyforecasting-zf6g4itjdnvysw9728jpcz.streamlit.app/)
 
- Analyzed market predicting top Spotify streams, initially applied ARIMA and exponential smoothing models to predict
future streams based on daily and annual streams
- Back-Tested time-series models to minimize error (MAPE, MAE, MASE) on transformed data
- Settled upon adaptive model combining 6 different models to best model time-series and data anomalies
- Achieved best performance, on the hybrid model, after cross-validating on rolling windows
